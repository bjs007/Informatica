# Informatica

This is a Kotlin application. In this small project, we are aiming to build an application written in Kotlin on Android which takes inputs (First Name, Last Name, Street, State, City, Zip) from a screen.  The requirement also includes to auto populate the Address field of the user. First and Last number are provided by the user. The entire information is then bundled in a JSON Object to be sent to a web service. We do not need to write code to send the Jason object.
